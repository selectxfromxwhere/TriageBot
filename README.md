# TriageBot
This is my original project called TriageBot, built in Python 3

TriageBot is intended to mimic the triage process in an Emergency Room. 
I was motivated to build this project for a college programming course I'm taking while working full time as an ER nurse.
This project will be improved upon and new technologies employed as I continue to work through my degree.
My plan for it is to become a web application complete with a GUI.


Of course the program faces contraints considering the fact that there are seemingly infinite symptoms and combinations of symptoms. 
In this current iteration, TriageBot will evaluate for symptoms related to the "Big 3" body systems of highest priority in emergency medicine - Airway, Breathing, and Circulation.
